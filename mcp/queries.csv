monitoring and fault management framework for users. In affected versions a command
injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server
running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The
vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without
authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr`
and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this,
it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname
corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns
`true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the
implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file
`lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of
the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker.
Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running
Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header
`Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address
of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP
address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because
of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an
attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The
called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the
corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item`
equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script.
The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function
`get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted
into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By
e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the
vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the
`action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of
these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is
that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely
on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like
`Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an
unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type
`POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented
by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an
arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER`
variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented
to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in
both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing
the patch.",_asset.products:Cacti AND vendor:Cacti AND product:Cacti AND (version:>0 AND version:<1.2.23),false,true,true,Critical,true,rz-query-vuln-cacti-1-2-22-rce,CVE-2022-46169,9.80,0.00,9.80,0.00,cpe:/a:cacti:cacti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*,"Upgrade Cacti to version 1.2.23, 1.3.0, or later","{""confidence"":""high"",""cwe"":""CWE-74\nCWE-78\nCWE-863"",""links"":{""cves"":[{""title"":""CVE-2022-46169"",""url"":""https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2022-46169""}],""urls"":[{""url"":""https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/7f0e16312dd5ce20f93744ef8b9c3b0f1ece2216""},{""url"":""https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/a8d59e8fa5f0054aa9c6981b1cbe30ef0e2a0ec9""},{""url"":""https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/b43f13ae7f1e6bfe4e8e56a80a7cd867cf2db52b""},{""url"":""https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-6p93-p743-35gf""}]}}",true,rz-finding-vulnerability-rce

- A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042,
RV042G, RV082, RV320 and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper
validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and access
unauthorized data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid
administrative credentials on the affected device. (CVE-2023-20026)
- A vulnerability in the upload module of Cisco RV340 and RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers
could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected
device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific
HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests
to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the device. (CVE-2024-20416)
- A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W,
RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based
management interface discloses sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit
could allow an attacker to elevate privileges from guest to admin. (CVE-2024-20393)
- A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W,
RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the
attacker must have valid admin credentials. This vulnerability exists because the web-based
management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the
underlying operating system. (CVE-2024-20470)
- A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042,
RV042G, and RV082 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass
authentication on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of
user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and gain root access on the underlying
operating system. (CVE-2023-20025)

- A vulnerability in the JSON-RPC API feature in Cisco Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator
(NSO) and ConfD that is used by the web-based management interfaces of Cisco Optical Site
Manager and Cisco RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to modify the configuration of an affected application or device.&nbsp; This
vulnerability is due to improper authorization checks on the API. An attacker with
privileges sufficient to access the affected application or device could exploit this
vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the JSON-RPC API. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to make unauthorized modifications to the configuration of the affected
application or device, including creating new user accounts or elevating their own
privileges on an affected system. (CVE-2024-20381)
- A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV042, RV042G,
